# ShipFast

NextJS boilerplate for fast web development

:hero-img{:src="image.src" :alt="image.alt"}

__ShipFast__ provides users with a code boilerplate to develop web applications without spending time and effort to build from scratch. The product focuses on modern technology solutions such as NextJS, NextAuth, MongoDB, Stripe, TailwindCSS, Mailgun, and some others.

The product was built and developed since 2024 by [Marc Lou](https://twitter.com/marc_louvion), a French software engineer.

## Revenue model

ShipFast generates revenue by selling the boilerplate permanently to users, divided into 2 packages that suit users' needs.

With this model, the product has earned around :price{:v=revenue}/month, according to the [author's sharing](https://twitter.com/marc_louvion/status/1778441634893762681).

## Marketing strategy

ShipFast was initially well received mainly from the Twitter community, after Marc Lou spent a lot of effort to build a large following on this social network. At the same time, knowledge, experience, development process, revenue, and profit of the product are shared publicly on Twitter, bringing him a lot of attention and interaction from the indie hacker community.

In addition, Marc's marketing and promotion capabilities are not to be underrated when being able to continuously provide useful information, funny, high-quality, and valuable videos to the community, helping the product to be widely known and create a strong viral effect.

## Some other information

- Marc has built more than 20 different products and has failed many times over the years before achieving a breakthrough success with ShipFast.
- ShipFast is a result of the experiences and knowledge that Marc has learned through the development of previous products.
