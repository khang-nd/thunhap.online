## Marketing strategy

Remote Rocketship's traffic mainly comes from Lior applying his SEO knowledge and skills. At the same time, a large wave of layoffs from many large corporates during the pandemic and economic downturn created a great opportunity for Remote Rocketship. As a result, at peak times, the site attracted over 200,000 monthly visitors.
