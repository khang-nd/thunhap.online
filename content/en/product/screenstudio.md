# Screen Studio

Screen recording and editing app for MacOS

:hero-img{:src="image.src" :alt="image.alt"}

__Screen Studio__ provides a high-quality and easy-to-use screen recording solution for MacOS users. The app offers a range of powerful video recording and editing features such as automatic zoom, custom mouse cursor, custom background color, cutting, speeding, adding effects, etc. baked in the same app without the need for complex video editing software and skills.

The product was built and developed since {{ $doc.year }} by [Adam Pietrasiak](https://twitter.com/pie6k), a UX designer and software engineer from Poland.

## Revenue model

Screen Studio generates revenue by selling [perpetual licenses](https://www.screen.studio/#pricing) to users, with updates included for 1 year. The price is :price{v=89}/device via the payment platform :payment{id="lmsqueezy"}.

The recurring revenue that the product brings is not yet disclosed, but from some of Adam's sharing, the product once sold 400 licenses in the first month of launch, and once earned over [:price{v=3000} a day](https://twitter.com/pie6k/status/1610782639841226752).

## Marketing strategy

Screen Studio was initially promoted mainly through two social media platforms, Reddit and Twitter. For Reddit, Adam shared demo videos of the app on [r/SideProject](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/) and attracted attention and positive feedback from the community. For Twitter, the demo video was [shared](https://twitter.com/pie6k/status/1586214209741889537) on his personal account and quickly went viral when the video was made recording the Linear app and received attention from the CEO of Linear himself. The product was also posted on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/screen-studio) and received widespread support from the community, reaching the top positions on daily and weekly rankings.

In addition, thanks to the unique and superior quality of the product, the app has become more well-known, widely shared, and attracted more users.
