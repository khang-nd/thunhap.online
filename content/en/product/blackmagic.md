# Black Magic

Enhanced Twitter analytics and management tool

:hero-img{:src="image.src" :alt="image.alt"}

__Black Magic__ uses [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) to provide a range of useful features to users on this social platform, helping them easily manage accounts, posts, analyze data, and interact with the community effectively. The tool is released as a browser extension and mobile app.

The tool was built and developed from {{ $doc.year }} to 2023 by [Tony Dinh](https://twitter.com/tdinh_me), a software engineer from Vietnam.

## Revenue model

Black Magic during the development period by Tony Dinh generated revenue through subscription, users paid to use the premium features of the tool. The price at that time was [:price{v=6}/month](https://news.tonydinh.com/i/125697037/the-deal-value), and at its peak, the tool brought in over [:price{:v="revenue"}/month](https://news.tonydinh.com/i/125697037/the-deal-value) for him, before being sold to another party for [:price{v=128000}](https://news.tonydinh.com/i/125697037/the-deal-value).

According to Tony Dinh's sharing, Black Magic had also been offered for sale many times, once with a price of [:price{v=500000}](https://news.tonydinh.com/p/jan-2021-i-got-a-500k-acquisition) but was rejected by him. After Twitter changed its policy on charging for API usage, he had to sell the tool to another party at the price mentioned above.

## Marketing strategy

Black Magic was mainly welcomed by the Twitter community, after Tony Dinh spent a lot of effort to build a large following on this social network. At the same time, the process of building and developing the tool was also shared publicly on Twitter, bringing him a lot of attention and interaction from the indie hacker community.

In addition to Twitter, the tool was also promoted through :directory{id=ph}, a popular platform to share and promote products worldwide.
