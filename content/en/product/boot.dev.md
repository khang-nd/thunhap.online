# Boot.dev

Online platform to learn back-end development through practice

:hero-img{:src="image.src" :alt="image.alt"}

__Boot.dev__ provides online courses on back-end development. The courses focus on teaching knowledge from basic to advanced by practicing writing code, building real-world applications through an online compiler, supporting some popular programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Go. Boot.dev also applies gamification in course design, helping students to study effectively and persistently as playing games.

Since {{ $doc.year }}, the platform was founded and built by [Lane Wagner](https://twitter.com/wagslane), a software engineer from the US. Currently, Boot.dev is operating with a development team of 5 - 10 people.

## Revenue model

Boot.dev generates revenue through [subscription fees](https://www.boot.dev/pricing) for students who want to unlock all courses on the platform, with prices ranging from :price{v=15} - :price{v=49} per month, depending on the location of the student.

In the first 2 years, the platform achieved relatively low revenue, reaching a maximum of :price{v=1000}/month. Then from the end of 2022, Lane successfully raised [:price{v=330000}](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/boot-dev/profitable-at-last--NSJjE6jtyCGyzW2g5Ca) from an investor, helping the platform focus on development and grow rapidly, currently at :price{:v=revenue}/month, according to Lane's sharing in a podcast of [Startups for the Rest of Us](https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-688-growing-boot-dev-from-6k-to-110k-in-monthly-revenue-in-15-months).

## Marketing strategy

Boot.dev mainly targets a specific group of people, those who want to learn back-end development, thereby focusing on creating high-quality, engaging content around related topics, in the form of videos, articles, or podcasts, and sharing through blogs and many social media channels such as [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@bootdotdev), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bootdotdev).

In addition, thanks to the good quality, the platform has also been shared and introduced by many coding YouTube and podcast channels, pulling a surge in the number of users.
