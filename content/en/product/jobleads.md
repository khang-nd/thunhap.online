Get contact information for companies that are recruiting

:hero-img{:src="image.src" :alt="image.alt"}

__Jobleads__ provides an automated solution to collect and aggregate job listings and contact information from companies with recruitment needs, helping recruitment firms and agencies find potential customers quickly and efficiently. Jobleads scrapes information from leading job sites such as Linkedin and Indeed, then aggregates this information into a database for easy search, filter, classification, and present to users through an API or Airtable depending on their needs.

The product was co-founded and developed in {{ $doc.year }} by [Cas Van Oort](https://www.linkedin.com/in/casvanoort), a former recruiter, and [Ruben Strootman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruben-strootman), a business development specialist, both from the Netherlands.

## Revenue model

Jobleads generates revenue through a subscription model based on the customer's usage. The price of service packages starts at :price{v=180}/month and can go up to over :price{v=2400}/month, corresponding to the amount of information customers want to access.

With this model, the product achieves a revenue of :price{:v=revenue}/month, according to information from [Growth Archive](https://www.growtharchive.xyz/strategy/jobleads).

## Marketing strategy

Jobleads was initially promoted through Cas's connections in the recruitment industry after many years of working in this field. The product was then promoted with Cas's appearance on podcasts, combined with blog posts sharing professional knowledge on the Jobleads website, helping the product appear on search engines for related keywords, while also being more widely known and attracting more potential customers.
