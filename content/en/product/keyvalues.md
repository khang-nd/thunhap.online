:hero-img{:src="image.src" :alt="image.alt"}

__Key Values__ allows developers and software engineers to find jobs from companies that match their values and work culture. They can also sign up to receive news and information via email weekly. With various criteria such as team values, daily routines, and career growth, Key Values helps job seekers understand more about the company before applying and helps companies attract candidates who fit their values and culture.

The product was built and developed since {{ $doc.year }} by [Lynne Tye](https://twitter.com/lynnetye), an American software engineer.

## Revenue model

Key Values generates revenue by charging an annual flat fee from companies that want to post their profiles and information on the website. Companies and recruiters can contact Lynne for [submission](https://www.keyvalues.com/submit) via email and pay a subscription at an negotiated price.

With this model, Key Values reached a revenue of :price{v=350000}/year, equivalent to :price{:v=revenue}/month, according to Lynne's sharing on a [podcast](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/086-lynne-tye-of-key-values) on Indie Hackers in 2019.

## Marketing strategy

Key Values was mainly promoted through [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=lynnetye), a large and reputable technology social network, and [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/key-values), a platform for product launches. These are two effective marketing channels that have helped Key Values attract a large user base and gain attention from the community, specifically posts on both platforms have received many upvotes and positive comments.

In addition, Key Values also applies content marketing methods such as blogging, SEO, and sharing experiences and knowledge about startups, product development on other online forums and communities such as [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/key-values) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/keyvaluesio).
