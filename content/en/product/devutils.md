:hero-img{:src="image.src" :alt="image.alt"}

__DevUtils__ provides a collection of utilities and tools for developers on MacOS. With many convenient features integrated into a single app such as conversion (time, color, data type), validation (JSON, URL), encoding/decoding (HTML entity, URL) or generating (hash, QR, UUID)... the app saves a lot of time and improves the efficiency of its users.

The product was built and developed since {{ $doc.year }} by [Tony Dinh](https://twitter.com/tdinh_me), a software engineer from Vietnam.

## Revenue model

DevUtils generates revenue by selling software licenses, with updates available for up to 1 year. [Pricing](https://devutils.com/pricing) ranges from :price{v=24} to :price{v=40} per device, through the payment platform :payment{id="paddle"}. After 1 year, users can renew the update with a 40% discount compared to the initial price.

With this model, the product has brought Tony an estimated revenue of :price{:v="revenue"}/month, according to his [sharing](https://twitter.com/tdinh_me).

## Marketing strategy

In the early days, DevUtils was mainly promoted to Tony's friends and colleagues. After receiving many positive feedbacks, he shared the product on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24604291) and gained some traction when the post received many upvotes and made it to the trending posts of the day. Shortly after, the product was also featured on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/devutils#devutils) and reached the 3rd position of the Products of the day.

In addition to leveraging the famous community channels mentioned above, Tony also applied long-term strategies such as optimizing SEO and building a follower community on Twitter by publicly sharing the product development process and useful experiences, helping the product attract a stable long-term user base.
