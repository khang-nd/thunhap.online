# Geocode

Geocoding, batch geocoding and geoparsing API

:hero-img{:src="image.src" :alt="image.alt"}

__Geocode__ provides an API to convert location information (address, location text) into geographic coordinates (longitude, latitude) or vice versa, and display in various formats such as JSON, XML, CSV, GeoJSON.

The product was built and developed since {{ $doc.year }} by [Ervin Ruci](https://twitter.com/geolytica), a software engineer from Albania.

## Revenue model

Geocode generates revenue through [usage-based pricing](https://geocode.xyz/pricing) of the API, with a price of :price{v=0.0025} per credit (1 credit = 1 API request). In addition, the product also offers an unlimited credit subscription package at a price of :price{v=200}/month, and a self-hosting option on the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-oyheuvytbpoiu) platform.

With this model, the product has generated around :price{:v=revenue}/month in the first 2 years, according to the [author's sharing](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/from-0-to-10k-mo-with-a-geoparsing-geocoding-api-in-under-two-years-JpKQTSBcILcdw0XC0Qfj).

## Marketing strategy

Geocode was initially promoted by Ervin Ruci through the [Perl Advent Calendar 2016](http://perladvent.org/2016/2016-12-16.html) and some speaking at conferences. However, he did not focus on marketing, SEO, or any form of advertising, but the product still attracted a large number of customers thanks to its good quality, making it widely spread through word of mouth from users.

## Other information

The initial cost of Geocode was only :price{v=1} (the cost of buying the domain `geocode.xyz`).
