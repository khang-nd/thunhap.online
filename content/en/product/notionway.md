# Notionway

Providing free and paid Notion templates

:hero-img{:src="image.src" :alt="image.alt"}

__Notionway__ takes advantage of the popularity of [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), a versatile note-taking tool, to provide free and paid Notion templates to users. These templates help users save time and effort in creating note pages, project management, schedules, and many other purposes.

The brand was built and developed from {{ $doc.year }} by [Modest Mitkus](https://twitter.com/ModestMitkus), a UI/UX designer from Lithuania.

## Revenue model

Notionway generates revenue by selling paid Notion templates. These templates are sold on the official Notionway website, through 2 payment platforms: :payment{id="gumroad"} and :payment{id="thrivecart"}. The selling price of the templates ranges from :price{v=39} to :price{v=99} for each type, and from :price{v=299} to :price{v=599} for the whole set.

With this model, Notionway is currently earning an estimated revenue of :price{:v=revenue} per month, according to the [author's sharing](https://www.modestmitkus.com/products/create-once-sell-forever#:~:text=you%20my%20framework%20on%20how%20to-,build%20a%20%2435k/month%20digital%20product%20business,-from%20scratch.).

## Marketing strategy

Notionway is mainly welcomed by the Twitter community, after Modest Mitkus has spent a lot of effort to build a large following on this social network. Along with applying SEO techniques to optimize his website, helping Notionway appear high on search engines. And not to mention the quality of the Notion templates that Notionway provides, has helped this brand receive many positive reviews from the user community.
