# Pika

An online tool to capture and edit screenshots

:hero-img{:src="image.src" :alt="image.alt"}

__Pika__ allows users to capture and edit screenshots directly in the browser, providing many convenient and easy-to-use features such as taking photos directly from a URL or from an uploaded image, editing functions such as adding frames, changing sizes, shadowing, rotating, inserting text, colors, etc. In addition, the Pika product suite also includes an API that helps developers automate the image generation process and embed the image editing tool into other apps.

The product was built and developed from {{ $doc.year }} by [Rishi Mohan](https://twitter.com/thelifeofrishi), a design engineer from Germany.

## Marketing strategy

Pika is mainly promoted through Rishi's personal Twitter profile, after he has spent a lot of time and effort to build a large following and connect with many other makers. This is also where Rishi publicly shares the product development process, other useful experiences, and knowledge. In addition, the product was also launched on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/codezen#pika-2) and received many upvotes and positive reviews from the community.

Furthermore, the quality of the product also plays a significant role in promotion, when users are truly satisfied with the features and experience that Pika brings, they share and introduce the product to others, helping the product to have a stable user base and growth over time.
