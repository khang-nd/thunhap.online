# Visa List

Visa requirements for different countries around the world

:hero-img{:src="image.src" :alt="image.alt"}

__Visa List__ aggregates information about visa requirements for over 239 countries around the world. The website provides information about visa types, processing times, costs, and other requirements needed to apply for a visa. In addition to visas, Visa List also provides information about passports, regulations for entry, and many other travel related information.

The website was built and developed from {{ $doc.year }} by [Hari Krishna](https://twitter.com/1HaKr), an Indian software engineer.

## Revenue model

Visa List generates revenue by displaying ads on the website, charging regular and one-time fees from users who want to hide ads and use advanced features such as unlocking more filters, accessing the latest, up-to-date information and member-exclusive information... The prices for regular and one-time subscription packages are :price{v=9.99}/month, :price{v=49.99}/year, and :price{v=99.99}.

With this model, the product brings in a revenue of :price{:v=revenue}/month, according to the author's sharing on [Starter Story](https://www.starterstory.com/stories/visa-list-d8a3a153-66a9-4cf4-81ab-d9dc0eccce30).

## Marketing strategy

Visa List was [promoted](https://www.starterstory.com/tourist-visa-information#describe-the-process-of-launching-the-business) on many popular media platforms such as Product Hunt, Hacker News, Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. On each platform, the product received a lot of attention and positive feedback from the community, and also attracted a large number of users. Among them, Reddit is the platform that Hari values the most, with many responses that have contributed significantly to the product's development.

Visa List was then also covered by many major news sites and online newspapers around the world such as LifeHacker, Gizmodo, Gigazine, MakeUseOf, CzechCrunch... helping the product to be more widely known.

Although getting viral helps boost the product's visibility, Hari still aims for long-term goals, and focuses on SEO and optimizing the website to attract users from search engines. As a result, Visa List is eventually ranking high on search engines and achieving a stable growth.
