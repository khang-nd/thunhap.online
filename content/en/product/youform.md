__Youform__ allows users to create unlimited forms and receives unlimited responses for free, or upgrade to a paid plan with an affordable price for more advanced features.

The product was built and developed since {{ $doc.year }} by [Davis Baer](https://twitter.com/mynameis_davis), a marketing and customer support expert from the US, and [Abhishek Chakravarty](https://twitter.com/themkmaker), an Indian software engineer.

## Revenue model

Youform generates revenue through a single monthly [subscription plan](https://youform.io/pricing/) priced at :price{v=29}. Additionally, the product also offers a limited-time purchase of :price{v=399} for lifetime access.

With this model, Youform has earned around [:price{v=12000}](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1bcyy70/launched_a_typeform_alternative_and_we_hit_12k_in/) in the first 3 weeks after launch, and is currently maintaining a monthly revenue of [:price{:v=revenue}](https://twitter.com/mynameis_davis/status/1778771427874804034).

## Marketing strategy

Youform is mainly promoted through Davis's personal Twitter account (with over 18,000 followers at the time of launch), and Abhishek also publicly shares updates and product development processes on his personal Twitter account.
