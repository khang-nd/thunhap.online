# Xnapper

Screen capturing and editing tool for MacOS

:hero-img{:src="image.src" :alt="image.alt"}

__Xnapper__ provides many advanced features to support capturing and editing of screenshots, such as automatic image balancing, automatic background color and text recognition, and even the ability to dedact sensitive information. The software takes advantage of some of the solutions that MacOS provides to build a powerful, easy-to-use, and efficient screen capture tool.

The software was built and developed from {{ $doc.year }} to 2024 by [Tony Dinh](https://twitter.com/tdinh_me), a software engineer from Vietnam.

## Revenue model

Xnapper generates revenue by selling perpetual licenses to users, with updates included for 1 year. The selling price is [:price{v=30}/device](https://xnapper.com/pricing) through the :payment{id="paddle"} payment platform. After 1 year, users can renew the update with a 40% discount compared to the original price.

With this model, the software has brought Tony an estimated revenue of :price{:v="revenue"}/month, before being sold for [:price{v=150000}](https://news.tonydinh.com/p/another-6-figure-exit-and-the-future) after nearly 2 years of operation.

## Marketing strategy

Xnapper has been mainly welcomed by the Twitter community, after Tony Dinh has spent a lot of effort to build a large following on this social network. At the same time, the process of building and developing the tool was also shared publicly on Twitter, bringing Tony a lot of attention and interaction from the indie hacker community.

In addition to Twitter, the tool is also promoted through :directory{id=ph}, a popular product promotion platform worldwide.
