:hero-img{:src="image.src" :alt="image.alt"}

__Typing Mind__ started out as a simple AI chat interface, using the ChatGPT API to add features that ChatGPT itself does not support. However, with further development and growth, the software has become a multitasking AI chat platform, supporting many advanced features and many other AI types such as Gemini, Claude.

The tool was built and developed from {{ $doc.year }} by [Tony Dinh](https://twitter.com/tdinh_me), a software engineer from Vietnam.

## Revenue model

Typing Mind is currently generating revenue through two forms: selling perpetual licenses and subscription fees.

## Marketing strategy

Typing Mind is mainly welcomed by the Twitter community, after Tony Dinh has spent a lot of effort to build a large following on this social network. At the same time, the process of building and developing the tool is also openly shared on Twitter, bringing him a lot of attention and interaction from the indie hacker community.

In addition to Twitter, the tool is also promoted through :directory{id=ph}, a popular product promotion platform worldwide.

A significant contribution to the product promotion is the quality of the software and Tony's ability, as he continuously brings convenient features, highly appreciated and widely spread by a large number of users.
