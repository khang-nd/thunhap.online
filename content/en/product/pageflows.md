A collection of user flow inspirations from popular products

:hero-img{:src="image.src" :alt="image.alt"}

__Page Flows__ curates and compiles user flow inspirations from popular products like Amazon, Facebook, Google, Uber, Stripe, etc. in the form of videos and screenshots. It's a useful platform for UI/UX designers to get ideas, reference, and learn how famous products build their user experiences.

The product was built and developed from {{ $doc.year }} to 2023 by [Ramy Khuffash](https://twitter.com/ramykhuffash), a software engineer from the UK.

## Revenue model

Page Flows generates revenue through a [subscription model](https://pageflows.com/pricing/) to access and view all user flows without limits. The product targets both individuals and businesses segments, with prices starting from :price{v=99}/year for individuals and :price{v=199}/year for businesses (3 users).

With this model, Page Flows earns around :price{:v=revenue}/month, according to the [author's sharing](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-i-gained-traction-and-became-profitable-after-almost-quitting-pyxhdCYD1Ppe4HiWozl7).

After about 6 years of operation, Page Flows was [acquired](https://twitter.com/ramykhuffash/status/1721529887939309802) in 2023, with an undisclosed price.

## Marketing strategy

Page Flows was mainly promoted through another newsletter product by Ramy that had a large number of subscribers (over 27,000).

At the same time, the product was also launched multiple times on :directory{id=ph}, helping it gain more visibility and attract widespread attention and shares from the design community.
