# The Million Dollar Homepage

A home page that sells advertising space for $1 per pixel

:hero-img{:src="image.src" :alt="image.alt"}

__The Million Dollar Homepage__ is an internet phenomenon that emerged in August {{ $doc.year }}. The website was created by [Alex Tew](https://twitter.com/tewy), who was then a university student from the UK. Wanting to raise money to pay for his university education, he created this website, with the homepage containing a block of 1000x1000 pixel grid, each pixel sold for $1. Buyers can display small images with links to their websites on their purchased pixels, and when the cursor hovers over the pixels, a short slogan will be displayed.

## Revenue model

The business model of The Million Dollar Homepage is simply selling advertising space. Each pixel on the homepage is sold for $1, but because a pixel is too small to be seen, buyers have to pay a minimum price of $100 for a 10x10 pixel block.

Thanks to its unique and novel nature and rapid spread on the internet, within just 5 months, the website sold all 1 million pixels and raised a total of :price{v=1037100}, equivalent to about :price{:v=revenue}/month.

## Marketing strategy

The Million Dollar Homepage was initially known only through word of mouth. The first customers were also family and friends of Alex. But after earning the first :price{v=1000}, the website received attention from news websites, including famous sites such as [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/4271694.stm), [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2005/09/08/pixel_student/) and ranked top 3 on the "Movers and Shakers" list of [Alexa Internet](https://web.archive.org/web/20050926155110/http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/movers_shakers?lang=en). The website then quickly became an internet phenomenon, attracting millions of visitors every day and the number of pixels sold increased rapidly.
